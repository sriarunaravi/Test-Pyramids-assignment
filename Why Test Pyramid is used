The Test Pyramid is a testing strategy model.It represents different levels of testing arranged in a pyramid shape to show how many tests should be written at each level.
Layers of the Test Pyramid:
Unit Tests (Base – largest)
Service / Integration Tests (Middle)
UI / End-to-End Tests (Top – smallest)

Importance of the Test Pyramid
1.Ensures Faster Feedback

Unit tests execute very quickly.

Most defects are detected early in the development cycle.

Faster feedback helps developers fix issues immediately.

Reduced cost of defect fixing

2.Improves Test Stability and Reliability

Lower-level tests (unit and service tests) are less flaky.

UI tests are more prone to failure due to:

UI changes

Network issues

Environment instability

3.Reduces Maintenance Cost

UI tests are expensive to maintain.

Small UI changes can break many tests.

Unit tests are easy to update and maintain.

4. Promotes Better Code Design

Writing unit tests encourages:

Loose coupling

High cohesion

Modular design

5. Optimizes Test Execution Time

Thousands of unit tests can run in minutes.

A small number of UI tests are run only for critical user flows.

6. Provides Balanced Test Coverage

Each layer serves a purpose:

Unit tests -logic correctness

Integration tests - interaction between components

UI tests - real user behavior

What Happens If Test Pyramid Is Not Followed?

Too many UI tests - slow execution and flaky failures

Late defect detection

High maintenance cost

Delayed releases

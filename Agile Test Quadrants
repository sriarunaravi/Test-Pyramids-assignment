The Agile Test Quadrant is a model that categorizes tests based on:

Business-facing vs Technology-facing

Supporting the team vs Critiquing the product

It helps Agile teams decide what type of tests to perform and when.

Experience-Based Testing & Agile Test Quadrant
What Is Experience-Based Testing?

Experience-Based Testing relies on:

Tester’s domain knowledge

Intuition

Past defect experience

Examples:

Exploratory Testing

Error Guessing

Checklist-based Testing

Which Quadrant Is Used for Experience-Based Testing?

Quadrant 3 (Q3)

Why Quadrant 3?
1. Focus on Critiquing the Product

Q3 is about evaluating the product from a user perspective.

Experience-based testing finds issues that scripted tests may miss.

2. Business-Facing Tests

Experience-based testing checks:

Usability

User workflows

Real-world scenarios

These align with business expectations.

3. Human-Centered Testing

Requires creativity,intuition and tester expertise.

Cannot be fully automated.

Examples of Q3 Experience-Based Testing:

Exploratory testing

Usability testing

User journey testing

UAT support

Edge-case discovery based on experience
